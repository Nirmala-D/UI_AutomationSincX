SincX UI Automation Project

The **SincX UI Automation Project** contains end-to-end automated test scripts designed to validate the UI of the SincX Learning App. Built using a **hybrid automation framework**, it leverages the power of **TestNG**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **Maven** for scalable, maintainable, and reliable test execution.
